## Glossary Resources API

Named glossary endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/glossaries`
- `GET /api/v1/glossaries`
- `GET /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}`
- `PUT /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/glossaries/parse-csv`
- `GET /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}/export.csv`

`POST /api/v1/glossaries/import` was removed on 2026-10-22 (it took JSON, duplicated POST / PUT and had no caller).

`GET /api/v1/glossaries` is not paginated. Optional filters (unknown parameters are 400):

- `enabled=true|false` (the job-creation dropdown uses `enabled=true`)
- `source_lang=en`
- `target_lang=zh-CN`
- `q=physics` (name / description / id, case-insensitive; an empty `q` does not filter)

Create / update request body:

```json
{
  "name": "semiconductor",
  "entries": [
    {"source": "band gap", "target": "带隙", "note": "materials"},
    {"source": "density of states", "target": "态密度", "note": ""}
  ]
}
```

- `name` and `entries` are required (missing fields are 422); `entries` is replaced as a whole.
- `description`, `source_lang`, `target_lang`, `enabled` are optional. When omitted (or `null`), POST uses the
  defaults (`""`, `true`) and **PUT keeps the stored value** (since 2026-10-22; before, PUT cleared them and reset
  `enabled` to `true`).
- Optional `expected_updated_at` (PUT only): the save only happens while the stored `updated_at` still equals it,
  otherwise 409 with `error.details.reason = "glossary_changed"`. Without it, last write wins.
- PUT only updates an existing glossary: a missing one (also one deleted after it was read) is 404 and is not recreated.
- `updated_at` has millisecond precision (since 2026-10-22) and strictly increases on every save.
- Entries: unknown `level` / `match_mode` values and regex sources that do not compile are 400 with the entry's
  source in the message (CSV parsing stays lenient). Limits: 200 entries, source / target 200 chars, note and
  context 500 chars.
- Deduplication and the inline-overrides-glossary merge use one key: (source, context). Sources compare
  lowercased for `case_insensitive` and case-sensitively for `exact` / `regex`; context compares case-insensitively.
  The later entry wins.
- A job referencing a missing or disabled glossary (`translation.glossary_id`) is 400.

List item / detail fields:

- `glossary_id`
- `name`
- `description`
- `source_lang`
- `target_lang`
- `enabled`
- `entry_count`
- `entries`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

CSV parse helper request:

```json
{
  "csv_text": "source,target,note\nband gap,带隙,materials\n"
}
```

CSV parse helper response returns normalized `entries`, `entry_count` and `duplicate_count` (rows dropped by
deduplication; added 2026-10-22). It accepts plain CSV text only; a first line with tabs and no commas is read as
tab-separated (copied from Excel). Without a header row the columns are `source,target,note`. Errors carry the line
number (`row 3: ...`). Rows where source, target, note and context are all empty are skipped. A cell made of `'`
followed by `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR loses that `'` (added by the export).

CSV export:

- `GET /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}/export.csv`
- Returns `Content-Type: text/csv; charset=utf-8`, starting with a UTF-8 BOM, and
  `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."; filename*=UTF-8''<name>.csv`
- Columns: `source,target,note,level,match_mode,context`
- Cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR get a leading `'` (formula injection guard); `parse-csv` strips it,
  so export → parse round-trips.

Recommended import flow:

1. The user pastes CSV / TSV text into the import box.
2. Frontend calls `POST /api/v1/glossaries/parse-csv`.
3. Frontend shows normalized rows for review.
4. Frontend saves with `POST /api/v1/glossaries` or `PUT /api/v1/glossaries/{glossary_id}`.

Jobs and reruns: a job stores a snapshot (merged `translation.glossary_entries`) plus the user's inline entries
(`translation.glossary_inline_entries`). Rerun / stage retry that create a new job re-resolve against the current
glossary with the original inline entries; if the source job's glossary was deleted the rerun is 409
`glossary_missing` (`glossary_disabled` if it was disabled). See `docs/api/04-翻译/03-术语表.md`.
